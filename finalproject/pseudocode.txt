CSV to JSON (and Visa Versa)

LARGER GOAL
Ability to mass input many pieces of data into a JSON file

REQUIREMENTS
- takes data input fields and translates them to columns in a csv, also recording which level in the data is
- once additional rows are added in the csv, can transfer that back into a JSON in the original format
- can both replace or append data

FLOW
- use existing JSON file to export data
- export the fields to a CSV
- fill in the CSV manually
- if nothing in a cell, don’t put field into JSON
- recognize and cast types correctly
- export JSON file, updating the original file


PSEUDO-CODE
- Export Function
    - User input: what is the path of the JSON file?
        - if valid, continue
            - import all data from JSON
                - do it in a way that retains types and levels
            - create new CSV file with name of JSON file but with CSV extension on the desktop
            	-if already exists, prompt user if they want to replace it
            - export all data types into CSV column
                - if entry has a data type the previous ones didn’t have, include it in order
            - export all entries into CSV rows
                - if entry does not include data type, export nothing in cell
            - if successful
                - print that it was successful
            - else
                - print it was unsuccessful
        - if not valid path, prompt again
- (user updates CSV manually)
- Import Function
		-if already exists, prompt if user wants to replace
    - export CSV to JSON, retaining types
        - columns define data types and level
        - rows define entries
    - if successful
        - print that it was successful
    - else
        - print it was unsuccessful
- (user manually copies and pastes into the JSON file)


FUNCTIONALITY

- read CSV
- export and import from JSON/CSV while retaining types and levels
- use data in CSV to export to certain indentation and characters in JSON
- if CSV cell is empty, don’t make line in JSON
- how to write a new file
- how to read from a file
- how to take name of existing file and make a new file with modified name
- lots of string parsing
